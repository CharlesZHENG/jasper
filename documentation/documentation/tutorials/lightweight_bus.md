<!--title:Using Jasper as a Lightweight Service Bus-->



ping and pong

Need an updated JasperTemplates, so you show doing this w/ 100% dotnet cli calls.

In the template, show it being built by using JasperHost.DefaultWebBuilder() and listeners & configuration, with appsettings.json.

Have a sample that shows it configuring outgoing message rules of every type. And a listener.


1. Start with it using a lightweight TCP transport
1. Show routing rules
1. Show publishing
1. Add a listener


**Flip over to the next page**

1. Add durability with Sql Server
1. Show how to add the schema objects
1. Add RabbitMQ instead
1. Lots and lots of links
